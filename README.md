| THE PROGRAM LOOPS THROUGH THE ARRAY AND ADDS THE USER'S-INPUT SUBTRACTED BY ONE TO THE BEGINNING OF THE ARRAY UNTIL THE USER'S-INPUT EQUALS ONE | EXAMPLE LOOP: [1 <-- 2<-- <-- 3 <-- 4 <-- 5] | EXAMPLE LOOPED ARRAY: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] :ASSUMING THE USER'S-INPUT IS 5 |
| THE PROGRAM REPLACES EVERY NUMBER DIVISIBLE BY 15 WITH THE STRING "PING-PONG" | EXAMPLE: [1,..., "PONG" <-- 16 <--- 17 < -- 18]  | EXAMPLE ARRAY: [14,"PING-PONG", 16, 17] |
| THE PROGRAM REPLACES EVERY NUMBER DIVISIBLE BY 5 WITH THE STRING "PONG" | EXAMPLE: [1,... "PONG" <-- 6 <--- 7 < -- 8]  | EXAMPLE ARRAY: [4,"PONG", 6, 7] |
